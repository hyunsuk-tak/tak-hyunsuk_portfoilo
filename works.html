                    The image depicts a little boy with an innocent smile, and the key point of the image is the boy's
                    smiling face which is adorable, so I would like to paint him as naturally as possible.

                    My concept of this project is that "I am enjoying my life." My life in my country before I moved to
                    the USA was so busy and made me exhausted because I worked very hard. However, I have been able to
                    more free time to do what I after I move to the USA, I could spend more time on myself. So I could
                    do what I want such as learning drawing, dancing or taking a computer class since I moved. That is
                    why I choose enjoyment for the concept of this project.

                    became the concept of my playing card.

                <div class="panel">
                    My concept of this project is enjoyment. I want to make poster events for family, lovers or friends
                    in the upcoming holidays such as Fun Run, Thanksgiving music concert, Winter festival and so on.
                    I decided on this concept because I miss so much my family and friends especially on holidays. So I
                    thought about events for the poster that anyone could enjoy.

                    Create a poster by live tracing a portrait image in Illustrator. Duplicate the vector art 4 times
                    and color each using the Color Guide panel and applying 4 different color schemes.

                    I like the unique way the small business card folds out into full size and interesting CV. Also, I
                    think it is a good idea for self-promotes and contains a lot more information about the person in an
                    interesting way.
                    This design influenced my work as I can use the idea of extra information being hidden inside and
                    the coordinating colors and patterns.

                    The concept of this project is a trip. It introduces cities and countries through newspapers. I
                    chose this idea as my project concept because I like reading books or articles about travel.
